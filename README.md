# DnD5e Drag Ruler Integration
A Foundry VTT module that aims to enhance the Drag Ruler module for use with the DnD5e system. This includes tokens being able to easily and quickly change between their different types of movement speed (swimming, flying, burrowing, and climbing) and an 'automatic' movement setting to streamline your encounter setups. You will no longer have to struggle with Wisps only showing their 0 feet walking speed, or with Dragons and their multitude of different movement speeds.
  
In addition this module fully supports the use of the Enhanced Terrain Layer + Terrain Ruler modules, actors and tokens can be configured to ignore certain types of terrain based on the movement speed they are currently using. Swimming in water terrain or climbing in mountain terrain is no longer a problem for your characters and creatures, even your Ranger can be configured to ignore movement penalties in their favored terrain.

## Requirements
- <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd5e" target="_blank">DnD5e</a> system by Atropos
- <a href="https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler" target="_blank">Drag Ruler</a> module by Manuel Vögele
### Recommended

## Movement Options
A creature's movement speed can be picked by clicking a button in the Token HUD. By default this is set to automatic, which lets the module figure out what movement speed to use.

### Elevation
When a creature's movement speed is set to automatic, the module uses the token's elevation to determine its movement speed. Above ground the creature will fly and below ground the creature will burrow, or swim if water terrain is present. The usage of elevation can be disabled in the speed controller settings, in which case a creature with its movement speed set to automatic will always use its highest movement speed, or water speed if water terrain is present.
 
## Difficult Terrain
When using Enhanced Terrain Layer and Terrain Ruler, movement costs are calculated according to DnD5e rules. This means movement costs only stack between water terrain and other terrain.
  
A token can be configured to ignore certain or all terrain for a certain or any movement speed. This works for individual tokens but also for prototype tokens from actors and for the default token configuration in the core settings. By default swimming will ignore water terrain and burrowing/climbing will ignore mountain terrain.

The Token HUD also contains a button to quickly toggle all difficult terrain for any movement speed for that token.

To help streamline the use of flying creatures, flying tokens will be treated as if they were 1 elevation higher for the purpose of ignoring difficult terrain. This eliminates the cumbersome manual changing of a token's elevation to make it ignore ground based difficult terrain before landing back on the ground. This behavior can be disabled in the settings.

## API Flags
This section is for those who might want to make their own module interact with this one. Calling this an API is too generous but most of the data this module uses is saved to flags on the Token Document under `elevation-drag-ruler` (the old module's name).
  
- `selectedSpeed`
  - This flag when set contains a string of the token's currently selected movement speed, either `auto`, `walk`, `swim`, `fly`, `burrow`, or `climb`.
  - This flag is not set by default, in which case it can be safely assumed the token is in `auto` mode.
  - Although untested it should be safe to write to this flag in another module. The token HUD button will not update when it is already rendered but it should never desync as it always checks the current value of the flag before doing anything. I might expose a function in the future to force an update to the button.
  - I do not recommend setting this flag to a value different from the ones above.
- `ignoredEnvironments`
  - This flag when set contains the data of the terrain configuration in the form of an object of objects. The object contains all terrain ids from Enhanced Terrain Layer and an `all`, each of which has its value set to another object of all movement speeds and an `any` which are set to `true`/`false` (`true` meaning to ignore this terrain for this movement speed).
  - The "Toggle Terrain" button added to the token HUD also uses this flag, specifically `ignoredEnvironments.all.any`.
  - The object can be navigated like normal, for example `ignoredEnvironments.desert.fly`.
  - This flag is not set by default, in which case the default array found in the `getConfiguredEnvironments()` function is used.
  - Although untested it should be safe to write to this flag in another module. The button and config will not update while they're rendered but they should never descync.
  - I do not recommend changing the structure of this flag. The configuration menu will reflect any changes but any new terrains or movement speeds will simply not be recognized by the cost function.
  
As the MIT license suggests, feel free (and encouraged) to copy and adapt my code to work with any other rpg system.
